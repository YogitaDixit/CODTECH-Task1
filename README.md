### **Project Overview:To-Do List Web App**

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly to-do list web application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. The app includes features such as adding tasks with due dates, editing tasks, marking them as complete, and saving them in local storage so that they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the web app, including the input fields and task list.
- **CSS:** Styles the web app, making it visually appealing and ensuring a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the core functionality, such as adding, editing, deleting, and storing tasks.

#### **Features:**

1. **Add Tasks:**
   - Users can enter a task in the input field and optionally assign a due date.
   - The "Add" button or pressing "Enter" will create a new task, which appears in the task list.

2. **Due Dates:**
   - Tasks can be assigned a due date, which is displayed next to the task in the list.
   - This helps users keep track of deadlines.

3. **Edit Tasks:**
   - Users can edit an existing task by clicking the "Edit" button next to it.
   - The task will be removed from the list and loaded back into the input fields for modification.
   - After editing, the task can be re-added to the list.

4. **Mark as Complete:**
   - Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, visually indicated by a strikethrough on the task text.
   - Completed tasks are also updated in local storage.

5. **Delete Tasks:**
   - Each task has a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove tasks from the list and local storage.

6. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist across sessions.
   - When the page is loaded, tasks are retrieved from local storage and displayed in the list.

#### **User Experience:**
- The interface is simple and intuitive, designed to allow users to manage their tasks with minimal effort.
- The responsive layout ensures that the app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The use of local storage allows users to close the app and return later with their tasks intact.

#### **Potential Extensions:**
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Implement sorting tasks by due date or filtering completed tasks.
- **Task Categories:** Add the ability to categorize tasks for better organization.
- **Notifications:** Implement notifications for tasks nearing their due dates.
- **Advanced Editing:** Allow for more complex editing, such as changing priorities or adding notes.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding how to create dynamic, interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional features that make it practical and user-friendly.
